## What will I be learning

So we learnt how to work with GitHub desktop but that's not the only GUI available. Today we will be leaning how to work with Git GUI

#### Brief Overview

Git GUI is an alternative interface for interacting with Git locally without touching git bash! Learn more here [What the heck is Git GUI](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui)

## Tasks

- Create a new branch on your fork of this repo
- Add your submission file
- Add any beautiful content you can think of
- Add, commit, push to your remote repo using Git GUI

## How to Submit

- create your submission file e.g prosper-day12.md in your forked `git-13days-challenge`(i.e the devc repo your forked and cone)
- Add screenshots of of your use of Git GUI to your submission file

> Remember to fork this repo if you've not previously and create a new branch for your submission

Looking forward to reviewing your PR!
